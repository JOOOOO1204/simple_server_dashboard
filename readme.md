##README


"Banana Launcher" Was built for helping users to build a hosting server in their location. So hear me if you're a dear modder.

 **This python project is NOT trying to steal user's IP'S and doxxing them, instead, help them build their own host server by python. If you have any doubts, read the python code yourself. Theres nothing that records the people's IP and sends it somewhere.**
